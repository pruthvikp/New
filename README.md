📚 Yelp Reviews Classification with Multinomial Naive Bayes and NLP 🤖

This repository houses a comprehensive Machine Learning project aimed at classifying Yelp reviews using Multinomial Naive Bayes and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging the power of scikit-learn and NLTK libraries, this project dives into the realm of sentiment analysis and text classification.

### Features:

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the dataset, understanding the distribution of classes, and exploring key features that impact classification.

🔧 **Preprocessing:** Implement robust preprocessing steps including tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare text data for modeling.

🧠 **Modeling:** Build, train, and fine-tune a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment labels for Yelp reviews.

📊 **Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized to assess the performance of the classification model.

📈 **Results Interpretation:** Analyze model outputs, visualize key metrics, and gain insights into the effectiveness of the classification approach.

### Repository Structure:

📁 **Datasets:** Contains the Yelp reviews dataset used for training and evaluation.

📁 **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

📁 **Results:** Visualization outputs, model performance metrics, and any other relevant results.

### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
